## Date: 2025-07-23T22:13:45Z

### Files Removed

#### `frontend/src/utils/serviceWorkerIntegration.ts`
- **Status**: REMOVED
- **Reason**: File was completely empty (0 bytes)
- **Risk Level**: MINIMAL - No code content lost
- **References Found**: None
- **Search Scope**: 
  - All files in `frontend/src/` directory
  - All JSON configuration files in `frontend/` directory
- **Rollback Instructions**: 
  - To restore: `touch frontend/src/utils/serviceWorkerIntegration.ts`
  - File was empty, so no content needs to be restored

### Verification Steps Completed
1. ✅ Confirmed file was empty
2. ✅ Searched for imports/references across frontend/src
3. ✅ Searched for references in configuration files
4. ✅ No references found - safe to remove
5. ✅ File successfully deleted

### Impact Assessment
- **Bundle Size**: No impact (file was empty)
- **Build Process**: No impact (no references found)
- **Runtime**: No impact (file was unused)
- **TypeScript**: No impact (no imports/exports)

This removal is part of the architecture improvement plan Phase 1.2 to clean up empty and unused files.
